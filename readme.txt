The "Spoof Call and Malware Simulator(SCAMS)" system is a game developed by Florida Polytechnic University students Robert Grant, Katelyn Holt, Matthew Rigg, Megan Ruiz, and Emil Torres for the CEN4033 Secure Software Engineering Section 2 course. SCAMS is an educational game designed to teach players about five different attacks and threats that their mobile device is vulnerable to. The game has five levels, each dedicated to an attack or threat. As the player progresses through each level, they accumulate points based on how well they did. If the player is proud of their score, they can create an account and save that score to their account. The top 10 scores are placed on a leaderboard, along with their usernames, as "Certified Security Geniuses".
