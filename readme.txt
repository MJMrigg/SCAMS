The "SoCial Engineering Attack SiMulatorS(SCAMS)" system is a game developed by Florida Polytechnic University students Matthew Rigg, Megan Ruiz, Robert Grant, Katelyn Holt, and Emil Torres originally for the CEN4033 Secure Software Engineering Section 2 course and is now an ongoing research project for the university under the leader of Dr. Denis Ulybyshec. SCAMS is an educational game designed to teach players about the different attacks and threats that their mobile device is vulnerable to. The game has many levels, each dedicated to a specific attack or threat. As the player progresses through each level, they accumulate points based on how well they did. If the player is proud of their score, they can create an account and save that score to their account. The top 10 scores are placed on a leaderboard, along with their usernames, as "Certified Security Geniuses".
